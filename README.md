Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project
Introduction

The goal of this project was to give students an opportunity to collect, work with and clean data to ultimately produce a tidy dataset. For the purposes of this project, the definition of tidy data is assumed to mean the following (Wickham):

    each variable forms a column.
    each observation forms a row.
    each type of observational unit forms a table.

To this end, the student was expected to create an R program that does the following:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In addition, the student was also required to:

    Create a code book describing the variables and transformations that produced the variables in the tidy dataset.
    Create a README document describing how everything fits together (this document).

About the raw data

The raw dataset consists of data collected in a study using the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. A full description of the study is available here. The raw data is available for download here. The main components of the raw dataset were (see code_book.MD for more information):

    X_train.txt and X_test.txt: contain all the measurement data.
    y_train.txt and y_test.txt: contain an activity code for each observation of the measurement data.
    subject_train.txt and subject_test: contain a subject code for each observation of the measurement data.
    features.txt: contains information about each measurement variable contained in X_train.txt and X_test.txt.
    activity_lables.txt: contains a descriptive label for each activity code.

Usage

The program consists of the following files:

    run_analysis.R: the main program.
    test_analysis.R: a test suite that tests whether the main program satisfies the course objectives (outlined above).

To run the program, open R and run source("run_analysis.R"). The program will produce a tidy dataset in a text file called tidy_data.txt.

To run the test suite, open R, import the testthat library with source(testthat) and then run the test suite with test_file("test_analysis.R") (alternatively you can directly source the test suite with source("test_analysis.R"); if the program runs without any errors all tests have passed).
Program

run_analysis.R invokes one function, run(), which in turn invokes other functions in order to complete a series of steps. Its end result is a tidy dataset called tidy_data.txt.

run() executes the following series of steps:

    downloads the raw data (if it hasn't been downloaded already).
    invokes build_related_data_set(), which takes a set of file paths, using them to read a feature dataset (training or testing), gives the columns descriptive names by using the features dataset, adds in associated activities as a column from the activities dataset, adds another column with the associated activity labels from the activities label dataset, adds the associated subjects as a column from the activities dataset, and then return the related dataset. build_related_data_set() is invoked twice: once for the training data and once for the testing data.
    invokes merge_data_sets() with the two results of build_related_data_set() as parameters, which returns a merged dataset.
    invokes extract_mean_and_std_variables() with the result of merge_data_sets() as parameter, which extracts all the variables related to mean and standard deviation, and returns the filtered dataset.
    invokes produce_data_with_mean_per_feature_per_activity_per_subject() with the result of extract_mean_and_std_variables() as parameter, which groups all the subjects together, then groups all the activities together, calculates a mean across all variables, and return this dataset.
    writes the result of produce_data_with_mean_per_feature_per_activity_per_subject() to a text file called tidy_data.txt.
