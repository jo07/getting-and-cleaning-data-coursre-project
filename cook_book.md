Code book for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project

Note: this code book is for the tidy_data.txt file produced by exectuting run_analysis.R. It is not intended to cover the raw data. For information about the raw data, please refer to the README.txt file in the original dataset.
A numeric code, ranging from 1 to 30, each representing a subject for who activity measurements were recorded

    subject

A numeric activity code, ranging from 1 to 6, each representing an activity for which activity measurements were recorded

    activity

A label describing the activity

    activity_label

The mean across all observations for a particular measurement (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X) of the particular acivity (e.g. WALKING) for the particular subject (e.g. 1). Even though each observation represents a mean, the original measurement's name was used for clarity. For more information about the original measurements, read the README.md in this repo.
